		 * 
		 * This property is meant as an easy way to get a hold of the underlying router engine instance through 
		 * binding, or to give a `Router` component a prepared router engine.
		 * 
		 * Because the router is set as context for child routers to pick it up, it cannot be reactively set to 
		 * different instances at will.  If you must do this, destroy and recreate the `Router` component whenever the 
		 * router changes:
		 * 
		 * @example
		 * ```svelte
		 * {#key router}
		 *     <Router {router} />
		 * {/key}
		 * ```
		 * 
		 * ### Disposal
		 * 
		 * The router engine instance is disposed when the `Router` component is destroyed, had it been externally 
		 * given through this property or created by the component.
