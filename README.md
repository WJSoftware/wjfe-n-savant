## Features

+ **Always-on path and hash routing**:  Simultaneous, independent and always-on routing modes.
+ **Multi hash routing**:  Doing micro-frontends?  Routing tabs or dialogs using the URL?  Have as many paths as needed.
+ **Sveltekit support**: Add hash routing on top of Sveltekit's path routing via 
[@svelte-router/kit](https://github.com/WJSoftware/svelte-router-kit)
+ **Electron support**:  Works with Electron (all routing modes)
+ **Reactivity-based**:  All data is reactive, reducing the need for events and imperative programming.

**Components**:

+ `<Router>`
+ `<Route>`
+ `<Fallback>`
+ `<Link>`
+ `<LinkContext>`
+ `<RouterTrace>`

**Reactive Data**:

+ `location.url`
+ `location.hashPaths`
+ `location.getState()`
+ `RouterEngine.routes`
+ `RouterEngine.routeStatus`

All data is a Svelte signal.  Add routes dynamically or reactively, change route conditions on the fly, add more pieces 
of user interface on-demand, etc.  All works reactively.

### Two Library Modes

Most people only need the normal or "lite" version.  Use the full version to battle/counter foreign routers
(micro-frontend scenarios, most likely).

#### In Full Mode...

+ **History API interception**:  Gain control over the history object to avoid external code/routers from 
de-synchronizing state.
+ **Cancellable `beforeNavigate` event**:  Get notified of navigation events, and cancel when appropriate.
+ **`navigationCancelled` event**:  Get notified whenever navigation is cancelled.

## Quickstart

1. Install the package.
2. Initialize the library.
3. Define the routes inside routers.
4. Modify/Add your navigation links.

### Install the package

```bash
npm i @svelte-router/core
```

### Initialize the Library

```typescript
// In your main.ts, or somewhere BEFORE any routers are created:
import { init } from "@svelte-router/core";

/*
Default:

- Lite mode
- Implicit path routing
- No router hierarchy tracing
- Single hash mode
- Log to console.
*/
init(); // Or use initFull() for full-mode.

// Common case:  "I just need good, old-fashioned hash routing."
init({ defaultHash: true });
```

#### Electron Variant

In Electron, we must immediately navigate to the homepage (or your preferred initial route) right after initializing 
if you use path routing:

```typescript
import { init, location } from "@svelte-router/core";

init();
location.goTo('/');
```

> **⚠️ Important:** Hash routing doesn't require this extra navigation step.

For applications that also run in the browser, condition the navigation to Electron only.  See the 
[Electron page](https://wjfe-n-savant.hashnode.space/wjfe-n-savant/introduction/electron-support) online for more 
details.

### Define the Routes

`<Route>`s are added inside `<Router>`s.  `<Router>`s can be nested inside other `<Router>`s.  `<Route>`s can render 
`<Router>`s or other `<Route>`s, etc.  You get the idea:  You do as you wish.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Router, Route } from "@svelte-router/core";
  import NavBar from "./lib/NavBar.svelte";
  import UserView from "./lib/UserView.svelte";
</script>

<Router>
  <NavBar />
  <div class="container">
    <!-- content outside routes is always rendered -->
    <h1>Routing Demo</h1>
    <Route key="users" path="/users">
      <!-- content here -->
    </Route>
    <Route key="user" path="/users/:userId">
      <!-- access parameters via the snippet parameter -->
      {#snippet children(params)}
        <UserView id={params.userId} /> <!-- Intellisense will work here!! -->
      {/snippet}
    </Route>
    ...
  </div>
</Router>
```

### Navigation Links

The previous step added the `<NavBar />` component inside the router.  This is the best practice for full `<Link>` 
functionality.  Still, this is not mandatory.

```svelte
<!-- NavBar.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
  import { Link } from "@svelte-router/core";
</script>

<nav>
  <div class="nav-links">
    <ul>
      <li class="nav-link">
        <Link href="/users" activeFor="users" activeState={{ class: 'active' }}>
          All Users
        </Link>
      </li>
      ...
    </ul>
  </div>
</nav>
```

## Micro-Frontend Goodness

This router's implementation intends to cater for micro-frontends as best as possible.  The following are features and 
strategies that are possible with this router.

### Multi-Route Matching

Routers always evaluate all defined routes, so it is possible for more than one route to match.  This facilitates the 
layout of micro-frontends.  For example, a navigation micro-frontend could be inside a route that either always matches 
or matches most of the time, so navigation links are available the majority/all of the time.

### Simultaneous, Always-On Path and Hash Routing

Components (`Router`, `Route`, `Link`, `Fallback` and `RouterTrace`) with the same value of the `hash` property belong 
to the same "universe".  Components with different hash values belong to different universes, and these universes are 
parallel universes.  Components with hash value `false` use the URL's path name and will never interfere with routers 
that use hash routing (hash value `true` or a path's name).  The main micro-frontend(s) may route using the URL's path 
name, while specialty MFE's could route using the path in the hash part of the URL.

### Multi-Hash Routing

As of November 2025, no other router in the world can do this to the best of our knowledge.

Imagine a scenario where your MFE application would like to show side-by-side two micro-frontends that are 
router-enabled (meaning they use or need to work with a path).  With traditional routing, you could not have this setup 
because one MFE would take over the path, leaving the other MFE without one.

Multi-hash routing creates named paths in the hash value, giving routers the ability to share the hash value with other 
routers.  A hash value of the form `#path1=/path/1;path2=/path/2;...` could power side-by-side MFE's on, say, 4K 
layouts.

### EXPERIMENTAL - Replacing the `single-spa` Router

It is the author's intent to implement micro-frontends with only `single-spa` parcels and this router.  In other words, 
abandon the use of `registerApplication()` and `start()` and just mount parcels using this router.

[single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org)

## Unobtrusive Philosophy

This router library imposes minimal restrictions.  Here are some features provided by other much larger codebases that 
are not provided here because Svelte already has the capability.

### Transitions

Nothing prevents you to add transitions to anything.

```svelte
<Route key="users" path="/users/:userId">
  {#snippet children(params)}
    <div transition:fade>
      ...
    </div>
  {/snippet}
</Route>
```

### Guarded Routes

Guard routes however you wish.  Maybe with an `{#if}` block, or maybe using the route's `and` property that allows you 
to specify a predicate function.  There are probably many other ways.

### `Exact` Property on Routes

Not needed.  All matching is exact path matching, and if you want to opt out of the exact route matching, simply add 
the `rest` parameter specifier (`/*`):

```svelte
<Route key="admin" path="/admin/*">
  ...
</Route>
```

Now route matching for this route will behave as "starts with".  If you don't care about the value of the parameter, 
just ignore it.

### Lazy-Loading

Lazy-loading components is very simple:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  function loadUsersComponent() {
    return import('./lib/Users.svelte').then(m => m.default);
  }
</script>

<Route key="users" path="/users">
  {#await loadUsersComponent()}
    <span>Loading...</span>
  {:then Users}
    <Users />
  {:catch}
    <p>Oops!</p>
  {/await}
</Route>
```

### Navigation Events

There are no navigation events defined.  Simply write effects or derived computations based on the global `location` 
object's `url`, `state` or `hashPaths` properties, which are reactive.

```typescript
import { location } from "@svelte-router/core";

// Or $derived, whichever you need.
$effect(() => {
  // Read location.url to re-run on URL changes (navigation).
  location.url;
  // Read location.state to re-run on state changes.
  location.state;
  // Read location.hashPaths to re-run on hash changes (hash navigation).
  // The route named "single" is the one you want if doing hash routing.
  location.hashPaths.single;
});
```

### Parameter Types

There is no parameter type specification.  All parameter values go through type parsing:

+ If the value represents a number, then the parameter value will be a `number`.
+ If the value is the word `'true'` or `'false'`, then the parameter value will be a `boolean`.
+ If none of the above, the value will be a `string`.

If the demand for parameter value types grow, this might be reconsidered, but know that this is easily achievable with 
the `and` property on routes, or by specifying the path as a regular expression.

In the context of the following code, the path `'/users/summary'` would match both routes, so the one that needs a 
numeric parameter value uses the `and` property to type-check the value:

```svelte
<Route path="/users/:userId" and={(rp) => typeof rp.userId === 'number'}>
  {#snippet children(rp)}
    <UserDetails userId={rp.userId} />
  {/snippet}
</Route>
<Route path="/users/summary">
  <UsersSummary />
</Route>
```

This is the version using a regular expression for the `path` property:

```svelte
<Route path={/\/users\/(?<userId>\d+)/i}>
  {#snippet children(rp)}
    <UserDetails userId={rp.userId} />
  {/snippet}
</Route>
<Route path="/users/summary">
  <UsersSummary />
</Route>
```

### Reacting to Route Matching Events

If you're interested in reacting whenever (a) particular route(~~s~~) match(es), you can get a hold of the `routeStatus` 
property of router engines (which is reactive) by binding to a router's `router` property:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { RouterEngine } from "@svelte-router/core/kernel";

  let router: $state<RouterEngine>();

  $effect(() => {
    for (let [key, rs] of Object.entries(router.routeStatus)) {
      // key: Route's key
      // rs:  RouteStatus for the route.
      if (rs.match) {
        // Do stuff with rs.routeParams, for example.
      }
    }
  });
</script>

<Router bind:router>
  ...
</Router>
```

## Navigation

The recommended way of navigating is to create `<Link>` component instances to render links on the document(s).  If 
needed, however, there are 2 navigation functions in the `location` object:  `navigate()` and `goTo()`.

### `navigate(url, options)` - Routing Universe Aware

This is the preferred method for programmatic navigation as it understands routing universes and properly manages state:

```typescript
import { location } from "@svelte-router/core";

// Path routing navigation:
location.navigate('/new/path', { 
  replace: true, 
  state: { custom: 'Hi' },
  hash: false 
});

// Hash routing navigation:
location.navigate('/new/path', { 
  replace: true, 
  state: { custom: 'Hi' },
  hash: true 
});

// Multi-hash routing navigation:
location.navigate('/new/path', { 
  replace: true, 
  state: { custom: 'Hi' },
  hash: 'path1' 
});

// Preserve existing query parameters:
location.navigate('/new/path', { 
  preserveQuery: true,
  hash: false
});
```

The `navigate()` method automatically:
- Associates state with the correct routing universe based on the `hash` option
- Preserves other routing universe states (e.g., when navigating `path1`, other named paths remain intact)
- Handles URL construction using the robust `calculateHref()` logic

### `goTo(url, options)` - Direct URL Navigation  

This method provides direct URL navigation without routing universe awareness:

```typescript
import { location } from "@svelte-router/core";

// Direct URL navigation:
location.goTo('https://example.com/new/path', { 
  replace: true,
  state: { path: undefined, hash: {} }  // Must provide complete State object
});

// Shallow routing (navigate to current URL):
location.goTo('', { replace: true });

// Preserve query parameters:
location.goTo('/new/path', { 
  preserveQuery: ['param1', 'param2'] 
});
```

**⚠️ Important:** `goTo()` requires you to provide a complete `State` object and does not understand routing 
universes. Use `navigate()` unless you specifically need direct URL control.

### Options Reference

Both methods support these common options:

- **`replace?: boolean`** - Replace current URL instead of pushing new entry (default: `false`)
- **`preserveQuery?: PreserveQuery`** - Preserve current query parameters (default: `false`)
  - `true` - Preserve all query parameters
  - `string` - Preserve specific parameter by name  
  - `string[]` - Preserve multiple specific parameters

Additional `navigate()` options:
- **`hash?: Hash`** - Routing universe to associate with (`false`, `true`, or named hash)
- **`state?: any`** - State data to associate with the navigation

Additional `goTo()` options:
- **`state?: State`** - Complete state object conforming to library expectations

### Navigation Best Practices

1. **Use `<Link>` components** for user-triggered navigation
2. **Use `navigate()`** for programmatic navigation within routing universes
3. **Use `goTo()`** only for direct URL manipulation
4. **Try to specify `hash`** in `navigate()` instead of relying on the default hash whenever possible

Just in case you are wondering:  This navigation logic is already there in `<Link>` components:

```svelte
<!-- Path Routing => https://example.com/new/path -->
<Link hash="false" href="/new/path">Click Me!</Link>

<!-- Hash Routing => https://example.com/#/new/path -->
<Link hash="true" href="/new/path">Click Me!</Link>

<!-- Multi Hash Routing => https://example.com/#path1=/new/path -->
<!-- Will also preserve any other named paths -->
<Link hash="path1" href="/new/path">Click Me!</Link>
```

As seen, the value of the `href` property never changes.  It's always a path, regardless of the routing universe.

> **⚠️ Important:** Not setting the `hash` property is **not the same** as setting it to `false`.  When `hash` is 
> `undefined`, either because the property is not specified at all, or its value is set to `undefined` explicitly, the 
> value of the `defaultHash` library option, which is set when the library is initialized, will be used instead.
>
> This is true for all components that support the `hash` property.

## Playing with Fire

At your own risk, you could use exported API like `getRouterContext()` and `setRouterContext()` to perform unholy acts 
on the router layouts, again, **at your own risk**.
